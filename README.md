# Decentralized Affordable Housing Allocation System

## Overview
This system leverages blockchain technology to create a transparent, efficient, and equitable allocation process for affordable housing. By decentralizing the application, verification, and allocation processes, we aim to reduce administrative overhead, minimize bias, and increase access to affordable housing opportunities.

## System Architecture
The system consists of four primary smart contracts that work together to manage the entire affordable housing allocation process:

### 1. Property Registration Contract
- Records and maintains details of available housing units
- Stores property specifications, location data, and eligibility requirements
- Manages property status (available, allocated, under maintenance)
- Enables property owners/administrators to update unit information

### 2. Applicant Verification Contract
- Validates the eligibility of potential residents
- Processes income verification and other qualification criteria
- Maintains privacy through zero-knowledge proofs for sensitive information
- Issues verifiable credentials to qualified applicants

### 3. Allocation Contract
- Manages the fair distribution of housing opportunities
- Implements configurable allocation algorithms (lottery, priority queue, etc.)
- Prevents front-running and other manipulation attempts
- Records allocation history for transparency and audit purposes

### 4. Compliance Monitoring Contract
- Ensures adherence to program requirements
- Tracks occupancy status and lease compliance
- Manages periodic re-verification of eligibility
- Handles exception cases and appeals processes

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Stack
- Solidity 0.8.x for core contract logic
- OpenZeppelin libraries for security and standard implementations
- Chainlink oracles for external data verification (income, employment, etc.)

### Privacy Features
- Zero-knowledge proofs for sensitive applicant information
- Identity verification without exposing personal data
- Selective disclosure mechanisms for compliance requirements

### Governance
- DAO structure for system parameter updates
- Multi-signature requirements for critical operations
- Transparent voting mechanisms for policy changes

## User Interactions

### For Housing Administrators
1. Register properties with detailed specifications
2. Set eligibility criteria and allocation preferences
3. Monitor compliance and occupancy metrics
4. Access transparent allocation histories

### For Applicants
1. Create verifiable digital identity
2. Submit eligibility information securely
3. Apply for suitable housing units
4. Track application status in real-time
5. Receive automatic notifications of housing opportunities

## Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites
- Ethereum-compatible blockchain (Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, etc.)
- IPFS for decentralized storage of property documentation
- Web3 wallet for contract interactions

### Setup Steps
1. Deploy the Property Registration contract
2. Deploy the Applicant Verification contract
3. Deploy the Allocation contract with references to the above contracts
4. Deploy the Compliance Monitoring contract
5. Configure access controls and admin roles
6. Initialize system parameters and allocation rules

## Development Roadmap
